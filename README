Small Utilities for Sun Cluster 3.1.

The utils allow to run another command in presence of given Resource Group (RG) on the local node. They can help you organise multi-node shared cron jobs, set profile/environment settings in shared home directories (GFS) and perform some logic in shell scripts, depending on whether the given RG is running on local machine or not.

scwrap executes the specified command with arguments, for example: 
scwrap myapp-rg command arg1 arg2 

scck returns 0 or 1 depending on presence of the specified RG, for example: 
scck myapp-rg && command arg1 arg2
or as parameter of "if" command:
    if scck <rg_name>
    then
        command
    else
        another command
    fi
